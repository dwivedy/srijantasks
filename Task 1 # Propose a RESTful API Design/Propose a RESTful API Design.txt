HTTP Methods Used:

GET - Should be used to retrieve data from the server. Means "give me a representation of this resource identified by this URL". It's worth noting that we must never use GET to change resources. 

PUT - Should be used to update existing server resources by replacing their old state with a new one. Means "use this representation to replace the resource identified by this URL".
